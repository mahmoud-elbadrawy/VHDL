# 📘 VHDL Course – Lecture 10: Case Selection Multiplexer

Welcome to **Lecture 10** of this VHDL learning series.
This lecture explains a **4-to-1 multiplexer using case statements** based on the `Case_sel.vhd` design.

---

## 🎯 What is a Case Selection Multiplexer?

A **multiplexer (MUX)** selects one of several input signals based on a select signal.
The `Case_sel` design uses a **case statement** to implement a 4-to-1 MUX in behavioral modeling.

📌 **Key Concept:**
> Case statements provide a clean way to handle multiple selection conditions in combinational logic.

## 🧠 Case Statement in VHDL

### Syntax:
```vhdl
case expression is
    when choice1 => statements;
    when choice2 => statements;
    ...
    when others => statements;
end case;
```

### Key Points:
- **Expression** can be a signal, variable, or complex expression
- **Choices** can be single values, ranges, or lists
- **Others** clause handles unspecified cases
- All choices must be mutually exclusive

## 🏗️ Case_sel.vhd Design

The `Case_sel` entity implements a 4-to-1 multiplexer:

### Inputs:
- `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` – Four data inputs (std_logic)
- `Sel` – 2-bit select signal (std_logic_vector(1 downto 0))

### Output:
- `Y` – Selected output (std_logic)

### Functionality:
- `Sel = "00"` → `Y = A`
- `Sel = "01"` → `Y = B`
- `Sel = "10"` → `Y = C`
- `Sel = "11"` → `Y = D`
- `Sel = others` → `Y = '0'`

### VHDL Implementation:
```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of Case_sel is
begin
    process(A, B, C, D, Sel)
    begin
        case Sel is
            when "00" => Y <= A;
            when "01" => Y <= B;
            when "10" => Y <= C;
            when "11" => Y <= D;
            when others => Y <= '0';
        end case;
    end process;
end Behavioral;
```

## 🔍 Understanding the Design

### Process Sensitivity List:
- `process(A, B, C, D, Sel)` – All inputs are in the sensitivity list
- Ensures the output updates whenever any input changes

### Case Statement Logic:
- **Direct mapping** – Each select value maps to one input
- **Default case** – `others` provides safe default behavior
- **Combinational** – No clock, purely combinational logic

### Truth Table:
| Sel | Y |
|-----|---|
| 00  | A |
| 01  | B |
| 10  | C |
| 11  | D |
| XX  | 0 |

## ⚡ Case vs Other Selection Methods

### Case Statement (Behavioral):
```vhdl
case Sel is
    when "00" => Y <= A;
    when "01" => Y <= B;
    when others => Y <= '0';
end case;
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ **Clear and readable** – Easy to understand selection logic
- ✅ **Scalable** – Easy to add more cases
- ✅ **Safe** – `others` clause handles unexpected values

### If-Else Chain:
```vhdl
if Sel = "00" then
    Y <= A;
elsif Sel = "01" then
    Y <= B;
else
    Y <= '0';
end if;
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ **Flexible conditions** – Can use complex expressions
- ❌ **Priority encoding** – Implied priority in synthesis

### When-Else (Dataflow):
```vhdl
Y <= A when Sel = "00" else
     B when Sel = "01" else
     '0';
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ **Concurrent** – No process needed
- ❌ **Verbose** – Gets complex with many conditions

## 🧪 Testing the Multiplexer

### Test Cases:
- **Sel = "00"** → Y should follow A
- **Sel = "01"** → Y should follow B
- **Sel = "10"** → Y should follow C
- **Sel = "11"** → Y should follow D
- **Sel = "XX"** → Y should be '0'

### Waveform Example:
```
Sel: 00 01 10 11 00
A:   1  1  0  0  1
B:   0  0  1  1  0
C:   1  1  1  0  1
D:   0  0  0  1  0
Y:   1  0  1  1  1
```

## 💡 Best Practices for Case Statements

### 1️⃣ Use `others` Clause:
```vhdl
case Sel is
    when "00" => Y <= A;
    when "01" => Y <= B;
    when others => Y <= '0';  -- Safe default
end case;
```

### 2️⃣ Mutually Exclusive Choices:
Ensure no overlapping choices – synthesis tools will warn about this.

### 3️⃣ Complete Coverage:
Every possible value should be covered, or use `others`.

### 4️⃣ Readable Formatting:
```vhdl
case selector is
    when value1 =>
        -- statements
    when value2 =>
        -- statements
    when others =>
        -- default
end case;
```

## 🎯 Hardware Synthesis

The case statement synthesizes to:
- **Multiplexer logic** – Selection based on Sel bits
- **No latches** – Combinational circuit
- **Priority-free** – Unlike if-elsif chains

### RTL View:
```
Sel[1:0] ──┐
           ├── MUX ── Y
A,B,C,D ──┘
```
