## About
This collection is intended for personal learning and reference. Each folder contains focused examples or notes on a specific VHDL topic (e.g., combinational logic, sequential circuits, testbenches, verification, synthesisable idioms).

This repository is for personal study — it is not intended for external contributions, and there is no license included.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- `notes/` — Markdown notes explaining concepts, examples, and summaries.
- `examples/` — Small VHDL designs and their testbenches (one example per folder with a short README).
- `projects/` — Small practice projects or experiments (more than one file or an actual device target).
- `README.md` — This file.
